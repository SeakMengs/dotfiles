# Introduction

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup. It features auto color scheme based on selected wallpaper.
The dotfiles are managed using `GNU Stow`, there is a scripts in the `.config/scripts/syncdot.sh` which I use to sync the dotfiles, although keep in mind that `personal`, `etc`, `screenshots` will not be synced. For further information check `stow-local-ignore`. Feel free to use any part of the configuration that you find useful. Enjoy :)
